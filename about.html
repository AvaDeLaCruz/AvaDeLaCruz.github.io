						<p>
							By the end of my sophomore year of high school, I had already exhausted all of the advanced Computer Science classes at my school. During my junior year,
							I realized I had only two courses left to take in order to graduate: English and Gym. It was then that my love of learning pushed me to apply for college a year early;
							this way, I could continue to challenge myself academically and learn about what I love: Computer Science.
							Now, I am a sophomore at the University of Southern California pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.
						</p>
						<p>
							At USC, I serve as the Director of Service for our Women in Computing organization.
							I am responsible for organizing and leading Computer Science outreach efforts, such as coding events, throughout the year.
							Through this role, I am able to combine my love for teaching with my love for Computer Science,
							all while working to encourage members of communities that are underrepresented in tech to pursue computing-related careers.
						</p>
						<p>
							This summer, I worked at Amazon HQ in Seattle, WA as a Software Development Engineer Intern through the Amazon Future Engineer program.
							I developed a full-stack web application which facilitates meeting scheduling between Amazon SDEs and the AmazonAPI Governance Body,
							the group which approves changes to API definitions that directly affect Amazon.com. I loved this experience because I know that what I built
							is going to help many other people by ultimately making it easier for engineers to ship code which improves the shopping experience for our customers.
						</p>
						<p>
							Feel free to reach out to me, either by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ava-delacruz/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:avadelac@usc.edu">email</a>, about Software Engineering Internships in NYC, Boston, DC, or London for Summer 2020.
