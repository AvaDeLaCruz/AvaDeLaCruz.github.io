			<h2  class="first-paragraph">	HI, I'M AVA.</h2>
			<h3>I'm passionate about learning, encouraging diversity in tech through STEM education, and creating projects which help people.</h3>
			<p>
				By the end of my sophomore year of high school, I had already exhausted all of the advanced Computer Science classes at my school. During my junior year,
				I realized I had only two courses left to take in order to graduate: English and Gym. It was then that my love of learning pushed me to apply for college a year early;
				this way, I could continue to challenge myself academically and learn about what I love: Computer Science.
				Now, I am a rising sophomore at the University of Southern California pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
			</p>
			<p>
				At USC, I serve as the Director of Service for our Women in Computing organization.
				I am responsible for organizing and leading Computer Science outreach efforts, such as coding events, throughout the year.
				Through this role, I am able to combine my love for teaching with my love for Computer Science,
				all while working to encourage members of communities that are underrepresented in tech to pursue computing-related careers.
			</p>
			<p>
				This summer, I'm working at Amazon in Seattle, WA as a Software Development Engineer Intern through the Amazon Future Engineer program.
				I'm currently developing a full-stack web application which will facilitate meeting scheduling between Amazon SDEs and the Amazon API Governance Body,
				the group which approves code changes that directly affect Amazon.com. I love going to work every day because I know that what I'm building will help
				many other people by ultimately making it easier for engineers to ship code which improves the shopping experience for our customers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Feel free to reach out to me, either by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ava-delacruz/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="contact.html">email</a>, about Software Engineering Internships in NYC, Boston, DC, or London for Summer 2020.
