							Hi! I'm Ava. I'm studying computer science at the University of
							Southern California and will be graduating in May 2022. I have
							always been driven by my passion for learning to step out of my
							comfort zone and try new things, whether that means graduating
							high school a year early or deciding to live abroad in order to
							improve my Spanish speaking skills. I also care deeply about
							promoting diversity in STEM because I understand on a personal
							level how powerful and life-changing it can be to have a mentor
							who you can see yourself in; in order to give back, I consistently
							participate in and run volunteering events focused on encouraging
							young girls to pursue computer science. Finally, throughout my
							time in college I've come to realize that the potential positive
							impact that a project can have motivates me to continue creating,
							innovating, trying, and sometimes, failing, and I know that I want
							to continue to use my skills for social good.
