						<p>
							As soon as I realized that I only had to take two more classes
							in order to graduate high school,
							my love of learning pushed me to apply for college a year
							early so that I could continue to challenge myself academically
							and learn about what I love: Computer Science. Now, I am a
							sophomore at the University of Southern California pursuing a B.S.
							in Computer Science.
						</p>
						<p>
							Last year, I served as the Director of Service for USC's Women in
							Computing organization. I was responsible for organizing and
							leading Computer Science outreach efforts, such as coding events,
							throughout the year. Through this role, I combined my
							love for teaching with my love for Computer Science, all while
							working to encourage members of communities that are
							underrepresented in tech to pursue computing-related careers.
						</p>
					
						<p>
							During this past summer, I worked at Amazon as a Software
							Development Engineer Intern through the Amazon Future
							Engineer program. I developed a full-stack web application which
							facilitates meeting scheduling between Amazon SDEs and the
							AmazonAPI Governance Body, the group which approves changes to API
							definitions that directly affect Amazon.com. I thoroughly enjoyed
							this experience because I know that I built something that will help engineers to
							ship code which, in turn, helps improves the shopping experience for customers.
						</p>
					
							<p>
							During Summer 2020, I will be interning at Facebook as a Software Engineering Intern. 
							Feel free to reach out to me, either by
							<a
								href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ava-delacruz/"
								target="_blank"
								>LinkedIn</a
							>
							or <a href="mailto:avadelac@usc.edu">email</a>, about Software
							Engineering Internship opportunities for Summer 2021.
