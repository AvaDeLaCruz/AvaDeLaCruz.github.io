						<p>
							By the end of my sophomore year of high school, I had already
							exhausted all of the advanced Computer Science classes at my
							school. During my junior year, I realized I had only two courses
							left to take in order to graduate: English and Gym. It was then
							that my love of learning pushed me to apply for college a year
							early; this way, I could continue to challenge myself academically
							and learn about what I love: Computer Science. Now, I am a
							sophomore at the University of Southern California pursuing a B.S.
							in Computer Science.
						</p>
						<p>
							At USC, I serve as the Director of Service for our Women in
							Computing organization. I am responsible for organizing and
							leading Computer Science outreach efforts, such as coding events,
							throughout the year. Through this role, I am able to combine my
							love for teaching with my love for Computer Science, all while
							working to encourage members of communities that are
							underrepresented in tech to pursue computing-related careers.
						</p>
						<p>
							This summer, I worked at Amazon HQ in Seattle, WA as a Software
							Development Engineer (SDE) Intern through the Amazon Future
							Engineer program. I developed a full-stack web application which
							facilitates meeting scheduling between Amazon SDEs and the
							AmazonAPI Governance Body, the group which approves changes to API
							definitions that directly affect Amazon.com. I thoroughly enjoyed
							this experience because I know that what I built is going to help
							many other people by ultimately making it easier for engineers to
							ship code which improves the shopping experience for customers.
						</p>
						<p>
							Feel free to reach out to me, either by
							<a
								href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ava-delacruz/"
								target="_blank"
								>LinkedIn</a
							>
							or <a href="mailto:avadelac@usc.edu">email</a>, about Software
							Engineering Internships for Summer 2021.
